# Pokedex

Welcome to the Pokedex project! This is a simple GO CLI application that allows you to explore the pokemon locations, search for, view information and catch different Pokemon. It also has the option to save and load the state of the caught Pokemons so you can Catch 'Em All' sooner.
It uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch the data.
